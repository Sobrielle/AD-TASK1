## Rules, Practices and Principles

<!-- Do not Change this -->

1. Always use `AD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename `.php` files if they are pages; always use `index.php` as the filename.
3. Add `.component` to the `.php` files if they are components code; example: `footer.component.php`.
4. Add `.util` to the `.php` files if they are utility codes; example: `account.util.php`.
5. Place Files in their respective folders.
6. Different file naming Cases
   | Naming Case | Type of code         | Example                           |
   | ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | Pascal      | Utility              | Accoun.util.php                   |
   | Camel       | Components and Pages | index.php or footer.component.php |
8. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
9. Use proper label in your github commits: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` and `docs`
10. File Structure to follow below.

```
AD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ name.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ name.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
|   └─ js
|       └─ name.js
└─ components
|   └─ name.component.php
└─ pages

|     └─ index.php
└─ utils

```
